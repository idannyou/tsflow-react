# Deep leaning using Tensor Flow JS and React

### Thank You

I would like to thank [Procore](https://www.procore.com/jobs/openings) for giving me the oppertunity to attend Connect Tech 2019, where I took a workshop on Machine Learning in JavaScript; one of the many amazing perks at Procore (We are hiring)!

### Live Demo

Does not work on Mobile: [Live Demo](https://idannyou.github.io/tsflow-react/)

### Overview

Machine learning (ML) is all around us assisting and simplifying our everyday tasks. More advance ML tools will potentially make bigger decesions in our near future. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that uses neural networks to "mimic human response"; known data are used to predict the result of new data. It is important that everyone know the basics of ML to help understand and improve ML models so that the decesions they make are diverse, fair, and just.

### Demo Instructions

This demo is my very first stepping stone in understanding how deep learning, a branch of ML, works. In this Demo:

#### Insipired by [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/webcam-transfer-learning)

#### - user inputs (2) responses / classes

#### - user then uses their webcam to add data points to classify these responses

![alt text](https://github.com/idannyou/tsflow-react/blob/master/README/adding_samples.gif 'Add Samples')

#### - user clicks `Train`

#### - user clicks `Predict` to start prediction
